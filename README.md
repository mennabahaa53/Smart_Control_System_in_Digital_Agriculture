# Smart_Control_System_in_Digital_Agriculture
This project is a comprehensive system designed to aid farmers and agriculture enthusiasts in various aspects of crop management and disease detection. This project utilizes advanced technologies such as deep learning, sensors, and a crop database to provide users with valuable insights and support for their agricultural endeavors.
Features:
1-Leaf Disease Detection: The system utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze uploaded photos of plant leaves and identify diseases present in the leaves.

2-Sensor Integration: The Digital Agriculture Assistant incorporates six sensors to enhance agricultural monitoring and management:
Fire Alarm Sensor: Detects smoke or heat in the farm environment and alerts the user in case of a fire outbreak.
Moisture Sensor: Measures the moisture content in the soil, assisting users in determining optimal irrigation schedules.
Temperature Sensor: Measures the temperature of the soil, providing critical information about environmental conditions that can affect crop growth.
Water Level Sensor: Measures the percentage of water in water tanks, reservoirs, or other water storage systems, enabling users to monitor water availability and usage.
Moisture & Temperature Sensor: Measures both soil moisture and temperature simultaneously, providing comprehensive data on two critical factors influencing crop growth.
Irrigation System Sensor: Integrates with irrigation systems to monitor system status and provide feedback to users.

3-Crop Search: The system incorporates a crop database, allowing users to search for crops and obtain detailed information about them. This feature assists users in making informed decisions about crop selection and cultivation.

Simulation
The project includes a simulation component that emulates the functionality of the six integrated sensors. This allows users to experiment with the system without the need for physical sensors.
